# ~/.zshenv is eval'd early on, before /etc/zprofile which initializes the path
# with stuff from /etc/path.d, for reasons I don't understand at this point, it
# also uses other sources since I saw ~/.rubies and sdkman stuff in there
#
# Anyway, this will add this path at the beginning of PATH and that's what I
# want, ðŸ˜“
