# ~/.zshenv is eval'd early on, before /etc/zprofile which initializes the path
# with stuff from /etc/path.d, for reasons I don't understand at this point, it
# also uses other sources since I saw ~/.rubies and sdkman stuff in there
#
# Anyway, this will add this path at the beginning of PATH and that's what I
# want, ðŸ˜“
#
# EDIT: I FIGURED IT OUT!
# path_helper doesn't erase what's already there, it keeps it, but it prepends
# its own default stuff, meaning that if I were to export this PATH here, it'd
# be one of the first things in there, with the cargo stuff, and then the
# default stuff would take precedence, include /usr/local/bin
#
# Doing it here means we do prepend this path! We win!
#
# see: https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/tree/master/runcoms
# Make the new brew path the preferred one:
export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH
